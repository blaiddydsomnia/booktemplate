        <h2>happy bday my lover :3</h2>
        <p>it took a bit of time to <code>code</code> this. i hope u find it a bit silly, creative, and fun. i hope u've had an amazing bday so far. i feel rly sad that i can't do much for u on days like this :(.
            thank u for being so forgiving and patient, it feels so genuine when u reassure me that
            i don't have to do anything for u on special days. i've been so busy recently w math hw + my bioengineering internship, but i've been trying
           my best to at least push out smt small for u even if u say it's not necessary. (it's the least u deserve!) </p>

        <p>on another note, congratulations! u have made it thru another year. time passes by so fast. 
            i can see how time has sculpted u, whether it be through ur emotions or face. i feel rly selfish when i look at how kind u are to listen to me and allow me 
            to be emotional, even if i am eighteen, and not "young enough" to cry anymore. ur generousity is etched in the lines around ur eyes from staying up late to offer me solace
       , and ur humoungous heart gives me a place to allow myself to be vulnerable. the growth from ur character and features have proved that u have sowed each year 
            significantly, in ways beneficial to u.

        <p>during nights or days, when i have the same concerns, u always have the same responses.</p>
        <p><i>"yes, baby. i love you and you're so pretty."</i></p>
        <p>i know it might seem trivial, and it might be repetitive, but it means the world to me. maybe routinely things like good morning and goodnight messages seem mundane,
            but they add to the everyday bits of love that one may take for granted. my heart flutters when i see u smile, and i feel like i can do anything for u. i know that i can't always be there for u, but please know that i'm always present in spirit.

        <p> when u wld answer quickly to my tiresome questions, like yesterday during our val games, i knew i cld feel comfy w u. usually, 
            ppl get irritated at my extremely offputting behavior being repeated over and over again, but u take it like a champ. 
            <p><i>"yup, that's my part time job. echoing my gf's silly nyas even if she kept nyaing like a broken record."</i></p>
             it makes me rly soft to know that i'm treated wonderfully by u. time and time again, no matter how
            much time goes by, it seems like i'll always be lucky to have u by my side, no matter how unchanging it gets. </p>

        <p>this feels more like an anniversary letter than a bday letter haha. i don't know how to write a letter without sounding romantic, especially when it comes to you.
            even if there are some things that won't change w u, hopefully i can write a bday letter that doesn't sound like a valentine's letter w time. i hope u'll stay around
            to witness it happening. geez, my complaining abt my inadequate writing skills is taking an entire page up. thank u for allowing me to take up space once again.

        <p>for a long time in my life, i didn't think it was ok to be so open w someone. but to see u be so enthusiastic abt smt that society outcasts me for (<i>farts</i>),
             7 year old me feels happy to know her future best friend would love to be able to whiff the tendrils of the scent in his nostrils.to go back on the subject of time, i wonder how we'll turn out to be in a couple of years. will we be okay? how will we survive months? how will we survive years? 
            will it be easier now that we are older or will it be harder because of all the work and responsibilities that come with age?</p>

        <p> these questions
            make me feel aggravated at times, but i know that even if each grain of sand trickles from the hourglass, it will be okay. with ur perseverance,
             i could never lose faith in this religion that i call love. and even if i might doubt myself a little, u always are there to make sure that nothing is wrong.
              with every little nag that i hear (eat more and turn off ur lights) (be sure to finish ur last math modules before we watch chiikawa), i know that love exists. 
              because you are there, every time i need u. even if time weathers us into different people, i hope the love that we hold for each other remains static. here's to
              2 weeks (and hopefully many more happy birthdays) with u.

        <p>thank u for making it this far baby :). maybe next year, i will be able to hand you a physical card with the scent of my perfume on it. maybe i will bake you a cake, or hold ur hand as u blow out candles. maybe we will look back on this digital letter and laugh at how extra i was. but one thing is for sure, i want to be there for it. i want to keep seeing u grow, year after year. <br><br>sincerely,<br>ur silly girlfriend<br><br>
          <br>ps: everytime i see usagi think abt u now. especially one with glasses on. ur so endearing just like usagi. <br>
